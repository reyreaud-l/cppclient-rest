$ git clone git@github.com:reyreaud-l/cppclient-rest.git
$ cd cppclient-rest

## Usage

Doing a get request is dead simple:
```c++
#include <cppclient/cppclient.hh>
#include <iostream>


int main(void)
{
  cppclient::Connection connec;
  cppclient::Response response = connec.get("http://whatthecommit.com/index.txt");
  std::cout << response.get_body();
  return 0;
}
```

## Test

We use ctest shipped with cmake to run our tests. Simply run 
```
$ make test
```

in the your build directory
